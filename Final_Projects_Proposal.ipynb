    "The data I plan to analyze for my final project will pertain to barn owls. I'm specifically interested in changes in barn owl nesting habits or habitat ranges over time. I want to compare this to data regarding deforestation and climate change and see how these changes have affected barn owls as a species. So far, I have found a lot of data about both climate change/deforestation and barn owl's predicted habitat from the California Department of fish and wildlife. I think I would like to focus on this data for my final project. "
